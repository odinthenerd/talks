# talks
just a place to put all my slides

My presentation style incudes me talking a lot and just setting the mental context with slides. Although I do believe this works well for a live audience it is not well suited for viewing the slides afterwards since most of the interesting stuff is not on them. Never the less here are all the slides I can make availible (some hosts would rather not have me publish talks they paid for). If you are interested in any of the topics feel free to contact me.
